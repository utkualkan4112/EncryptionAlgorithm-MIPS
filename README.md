# EncryptionAlgorithm-MIPS

A basic implementation of a symmetric encryption algorithm using MIPS32 assembly language.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a symmetric encryption algorithm using the MIPS32 assembly language. It leverages a lookup table with 256 entries to aid the encryption process.

## Current Status

:warning: **NOTE**: The current code is in development and may not function correctly. Work is underway to debug and rectify the issues.

## Features

- **MIPS32 Implementation**: The code is written specifically for the MIPS32 architecture.
- **Lookup Table**: Utilizes a 256-entry lookup table for encryption processes.

## Usage

1. Load the MIPS32 code into your desired MIPS simulator or onto a MIPS-based hardware platform.
2. Input the plaintext data that you want to encrypt.
3. Execute the code to receive the encrypted output.

## Contributing

Feedback and contributions are appreciated! If you find any issues or potential optimizations, please open a pull request or issue.

## Future Enhancements

- Debugging the current issues to get the algorithm working correctly.
- Potentially expanding the lookup table or adding other optimization techniques.
